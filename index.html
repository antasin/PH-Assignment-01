                <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers.<br> While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates,<br> these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers.</p>

                    <h1>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h1>
                    <p>Without coding, we wouldn't have the websites, apps, and programs we rely on daily.<br> Coding also plays a crucial role in innovation and technological advancement,<br> as new software and applications are constantly being developed to improve our<br> lives and solve complex problems.</p>
